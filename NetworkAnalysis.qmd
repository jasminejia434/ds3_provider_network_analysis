The current NPI-TIN bipartite dataset is computationally intensive and requires significant resources, leading to prolonged processing times. To optimize efficiency and expedite the analysis, I am implementing a random sample of 3,000 individual NPI and TIN values for further processing.

The network graph illustrates the relationships between TINs (Tax Identification Numbers) represented by blue nodes and NPIs (National Provider Identifiers) represented by red nodes. The circular layout suggests that the visualization focuses on the connections between nodes rather than geographical or hierarchical relationships. The dense connections between red and blue nodes highlight that multiple providers (NPIs) are often associated with specific healthcare organizations (TINs). Certain clusters of nodes, circled in the graph, suggest tightly connected groups, which may represent providers associated with the same organization or sharing similar characteristics such as specialization or geographic location.

1.  **Degree Distribution**:

    -   The majority of TIN nodes have a very low degree, with most connecting to only one or a few NPIs.

    -   Similarly, most NPIs are connected to very few TINs. The sharp drop-off in the degree distribution indicates that only a small number of nodes have higher degrees.

2.  **Density**:

    -   The bipartite graph has a density of approximately 0.00026, indicating that the network is extremely sparse. This is typical for large bipartite networks, where not all nodes are interconnected.

3.  **Connected Components**:

    -   There are 1,778 connected components in the network. This suggests that the network is fragmented, with many smaller, isolated groups of nodes rather than a single large, interconnected component. These components may represent independent clusters of NPIs associated with specific TINs.

4.  **Clustering Coefficient**:

    -   The average clustering coefficient for the NPI projection is 0.3916. This moderate value suggests that there is some clustering among NPIs, meaning that NPIs associated with the same TIN are likely to form tight-knit groups.
